## Wedge Zone

### 50 - 125m (55 - 137yd)

- “Birdie” - within 3m from the hole (<10ft)
- “Par” - 3 to 6m from the hole (10-20ft)
- “Bogey” - outside 6m from the hole (>20ft)

## Iron Zone

### 125 - 175m (137 - 192yd)

- “Birdie” - within 4m from the hole (<13ft)
- “Par” - 4 to 8m from the hole (13-26ft)
- “Bogey” - outside 8m from the hole (>26ft)

## Scoring Zone

Add up the scores from the Wedge Zone and Iron Zone to form the result:

```
Wedge Zone = +1 from 5 shots
Iron Zone = -2 from 7 shots
Scoring Zone = -1 from 12 shots
```
